# LineInMixer

This is a project for a 2 channel line in audio mixer.
In my case, I use it to mix my electric guitar signal with the stereo signal from my phone to a single mono output. Both inputs are buffered and have separate volume controls. The mixed signal goes through a simple output stage with a master volume control.
